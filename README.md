The Notes App is a simple application designed for helping users create, save, and manage their notes efficiently. The project features clean and responsive user interfaces, making it accessible across various devices. Users can add new notes by providing a title and content, view all saved notes in an organized format, and delete notes they no longer need.

This project uses HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript. HTML5 was used for structuring the application, while CSS3 and Bootstrap 5 came into action for producing an neat responsive design. JavaScript handles all aspects of app interactivity and functionality, such as saving notes to use localStorage in case the page needs to be refreshed.

A user-friendly experience, Notes App has effectively blended functionality with a clean and modern UI. This project depicts my ability to create practical, real-world applications through the usage of fundamental web development technologies.
